Streamlined Management: The system facilitates the efficient management of hospital operations by providing separate interfaces for administrators, doctors, and patients, allowing each user type to access relevant information and functionalities easily.

Enhanced Patient Care: By offering features like appointment scheduling, health history tracking, and emergency contact management, the system aims to improve the overall patient experience and ensure timely and personalized care.

Improved Communication: The inclusion of features such as patient queries, doctor-patient communication, and news updates about health fosters better communication and engagement between healthcare providers and patients, leading to more informed decision-making and improved health outcomes.

Efficient Information Handling: Through functionalities like profile settings, password management, and data tracking (e.g., height, weight, blood pressure), the system enables users to efficiently manage their personal information and medical records, enhancing data accuracy and accessibility.

Administrative Efficiency: For administrators, the system provides tools for managing patient, doctor, and staff information, as well as handling queries, tenders, and other administrative tasks, thereby improving overall organizational efficiency and resource utilization.
